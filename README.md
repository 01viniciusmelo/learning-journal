# Pyramid Learning Journal Project

This repo contains the source code for my personal learning journalâ€”created in Python using Pyramid's "alchemy" starter scaffold, and deployed on Heroku with a `postgresql` database.

To get started with your own version of my learning journal:
```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
# 2. Initialize/activate your virtual environment
# 3. Install all the required packages, including testing:
$ pip install -e . .[testing]
# 4. Erase any existing entries and initialize a new database for your local environment:
$ initialize_db development.ini
# 5. Serve the page locally
$ pserve development.ini --reload
```

When initializing your new database, a default entry is created which you can edit or delete.

## Models

`jentry_model.py` contains the `Jentry` class: the constructor for all journal entries. `journal` is a SQL table that stores all entries created using this model. `Jentry` rows contain 7 columns of data:

```python
id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
title = Column(Unicode)
content = Column(Unicode)  # stored as plain text/Markdown
contentr = Column(Unicode)  # content after rendering into HTML
created = Column(DateTime)  # date/time recorded at post submission
modified = Column(DateTime)  # date/time recorded after most recent edit
category = Column(Unicode)
```

## Views

Found within `routes.py` and `views/default.py`. The pages are rendered via the Jinja2 templates contained in the `templates` directory.

- All views are extensions of the base `layout.jinja2` template.
- Route `list` runs the `list_vew(request)` function. This lists all journal entries on the index of the root directory/homepage, rendered with the `list.jinja2` template.
- Route `detail` runs the `detail_view(request)` function. Accessing this route expands an individual journal entry's content in it's entirety, rendered with the `detail.jinja2` template.
- Route `create` runs the `create_view(request)` function, which is used to create a new journal entry. It is rendered with the `create.jinja2` template.
- Route `update` runs the `update_view(request)` function, which is used to edit an existing journal entry. It is rendered with the `update.jinja2` template.
- Route `delete` runs the `delete_view(request)` function, which sends you to a warning page in order to confirm the deletion of an entry. This warning page is rendered with the `delete.jinja2` template.
- Route `delete_forever` runs the `delete_forever_view(request)` function. This function permanently removes an existing journal entry from the database and sends you back to the homepage.
